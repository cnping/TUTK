/*
This is a small implementation of the IP and TCP protocols (as well as
some basic ICMP stuff). The implementation couples the IP, TCP and the
application layers very tightly. To keep the size of the compiled code
down, this code also features heavy usage of the goto statement.

The principle is that we have a small buffer, called the uip_buf, in
which the device driver puts an incoming packet. The TCP/IP stack
parses the headers in the packet, and calls upon the application. If
the remote host has sent data to the application, this data is present
in the uip_buf and the application read the data from there. It is up
to the application to put this data into a byte stream if needed. The
application will not be fed with data that is out of sequence.

If the application whishes to send data to the peer, it should put its
data into the uip_buf, 40 bytes from the start of the buffer. The
TCP/IP stack will calculate the checksums, and fill in the necessary
header fields and finally send the packet back to the peer.
